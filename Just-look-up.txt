We knew no bounds 
Fell at the speed of sound
Riding... Against all odds, But soon against ourselves. 
You haunted every memory
With no goodbyes, all bad for me
Your pride put out the fire in our flames
Then just one look is all it takes
I feel your eyes they’re locked on every part of me
Then my dumb heart says... 

Just look up
There is no place to hide... 
True love doesn’t die, it holds on tight and never lets you go
Just look up! 
You cannot deny the signs...
What you’ve waited for, don’t wait no more. 
It’s right up above you. Just look up! 

(Baby) Know I let you down a n---- can’t deny it (Uh uh) 
And there’s so much I could lose and yes that matters (yeah) 
I’ve been dealing with madness (yo) 
Wasn’t the man you needed
You dealing with sadness
Truthfully it’s all on me 
And I’m sorry my love Imma heal your heart 
I’ll hold it in my hand
Time is ohh so precious, we don’t really have much left now  
Take my hand baby Never leave you Riley 

Look up
What he’s really trying to say
Is get your head out of your ass
And listen to the goddamn qualified scientists
We really fucked it up, fucked it up this time
It’s so close I can feel the heat big time
You can act like everything is alright
but this is probably happening in real time

Celebrate, Or cry or pray ...
Whatever it takes to get you through the mess that we made! 
Cause, tomorrow may never come! 

Just look up
Turn off that shit box news
Cause you’re about to die soon everybody! 
Look up
Here it comes
I’m so glad I’m here with you 
Forever in your arms
